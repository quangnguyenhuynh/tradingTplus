## Stock Daily ingestion

`daily` is WRITE — raw/clean ingest only. It fetches SSI v3 `securitiesSummary`, retains source payload/hash in `stock_raw_daily`, validates and persists canonical `stock_daily`. It does not run completeness or downstream calculations. No date means the latest weekday strictly before today in Vietnam. Explicit symbols are used directly; omitted symbols load active persisted master symbols.

`stock-eod` and its exact alias `stock-daily` are WRITE — raw/clean ingest plus daily-only completeness. They intersect explicit symbols with active master symbols and report ignored unknown/inactive values. Empty active scope returns FAILED. Their default date is the latest weekday on or before today in Vietnam, unlike `daily`. Completeness checks the current run timing and expected source. Neither route ingests indexes/intraday, writes a separate foreign-trading dataset, or starts features. Deprecated intraday counts/summary do not indicate an intraday operation.

Explicit weekend/future source-write dates are rejected. An empty holiday response is reported; rows are never synthesized. Both SSI and Supabase credentials are required.

```bash
python main.py daily --help
python main.py stock-eod --help
python main.py stock-daily --help
python main.py daily 19/10/2026 --symbols SSI
python main.py daily 19/10/2026 --symbols SSI HPG --data-source ssi_v3
python main.py daily --symbols SSI
python main.py stock-eod --symbols SSI
python main.py stock-daily 19/10/2026 --symbols SSI HPG
```
## Temporarily disabled commands

The eight commands below retain their parsers but fail before loading handlers or constructing SSI/DB clients. They return exit 1 and JSON status FAILED, error_type NOT_IMPLEMENTED. A rejected explicit source can instead return exit 2 in source preflight. Help still describes previous purposes; it is not evidence of availability.

| Command | Previous purpose | Required future adapter / dataset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sync-master-data, init | Idempotent master sync | Verified v3 master adapters preserving operator status; master |
| intraday-ingest | Source 1m raw/clean ingestion | Verified v3 1m adapter, pagination, timestamps, units; stock_intraday |
| stock-intraday | 1m ingestion and completeness | Same adapter; stock_intraday |
| backfill-intraday | Source 1m history | Same adapter; stock_intraday |
| backfill | Combined daily/intraday plus checks | Same adapter; stock_intraday; no partial daily work |
| refill | Single-symbol source/check/features | Same adapter; stock_intraday; no partial daily/features work |
| streaming-ingest | Bounded streaming, optional write | Verified v3 protocol/auth/capture adapter; streaming |

Orderbook capture is likewise disabled pending a verified streaming adapter; do not invent a public REST depth endpoint. Historical raw/clean/master/feature/streaming rows remain stored and usable under their contracts. No fallback, deletion or historical repair occurs from calling a disabled command. Below are help commands only, not production success examples.

```bash
python main.py init --help
python main.py sync-master-data --help
python main.py intraday-ingest --help
python main.py stock-intraday --help
python main.py backfill-intraday --help
python main.py backfill --help
python main.py refill --help
python main.py streaming-ingest --help
