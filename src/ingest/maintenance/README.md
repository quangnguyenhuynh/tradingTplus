# src/ingest/maintenance

Canonical CLI names and compatible legacy aliases (no removal date): `stock-daily-backfill` → `backfill-daily`; `stock-intraday-backfill` → `backfill-intraday`. Only CLI naming changes; runners, arguments, JSON flow identifiers and exits stay unchanged. Stock Daily/Index Daily backfill are ACTIVE / WRITE; Stock Intraday backfill is DISABLED / NOT_IMPLEMENTED, separate from the manual pilot.

[Tiếng Việt](README.vi.md)

## Stock Daily historical backfill

WRITE — raw/clean ingest: `stock-daily-backfill` requires `--from` and `--to`; `--from-date` and `--to-date` are aliases. Optional symbols apply to every included date; omitted means active master scope per ingest. Optional `--data-source ssi_v3` makes selection explicit; omission selects the ready v3 adapter, not the literal value `auto`.

The runner skips weekends, rejects future/reversed ranges, records per-day OK/PARTIAL/FAILED and continues across failures. Weekend-only ranges are OK no-ops. It does not verify completeness: inspect daily summaries and perform a separately scoped read-only check. Reruns may update existing clean rows and retain raw evidence. It does not calculate features or call the disabled combined backfill.

```bash
python main.py stock-daily-backfill --help
python main.py stock-daily-backfill --from 01/10/2026 --to 19/10/2026 --symbols SSI HPG --data-source ssi_v3
```
## Temporarily disabled commands

The command groups below retain their parsers but fail before loading handlers or constructing SSI/DB clients. They return exit 1 and JSON status FAILED, error_type NOT_IMPLEMENTED. A rejected explicit source can instead return exit 2 in source preflight. Help still describes previous purposes; it is not evidence of availability.

| Command | Previous purpose | Required future adapter / dataset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sync-master-data, init | Idempotent master sync | Verified v3 master adapters preserving operator status; master |
| intraday-ingest | Source 1m raw/clean ingestion | Verified v3 1m adapter, pagination, timestamps, units; stock_intraday |
| stock-intraday-backfill | Source 1m history | Same adapter; stock_intraday |
| backfill | Combined daily/intraday plus checks | Same adapter; stock_intraday; no partial daily work |
| refill | Single-symbol source/check/features | Same adapter; stock_intraday; no partial daily/features work |
| streaming-ingest | Bounded streaming, optional write | Verified v3 protocol/auth/capture adapter; streaming |

Orderbook capture is likewise disabled pending a verified streaming adapter; do not invent a public REST depth endpoint. Historical raw/clean/master/feature/streaming rows remain stored and usable under their contracts. No fallback, deletion or historical repair occurs from calling a disabled command. Below are help commands only, not production success examples.

```bash
python main.py init --help
python main.py sync-master-data --help
python main.py intraday-ingest --help
python main.py stock-intraday --help
python main.py stock-intraday-backfill --help
python main.py backfill --help
python main.py refill --help
python main.py streaming-ingest --help
```
